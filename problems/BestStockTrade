For a given stock, assume that you have an array which:
- Contains the stock's price
- Each index corresponds with a point in time
- The indices are in ascending chronological order (i.e., 0 is the earliest in time)

Given this array, and the restriction that you may not short, find the most profitable pair of buy/sell indices.
